# Pima Indian Diabetes Statistical Analysis 
This repository contains statistical data analysis aiming to explore the onset of diabetes within a population of Pima Indian women.

## Project Description

This project focuses on understanding the factors contributing to diabetes and developing predictive models to identify individuals at higher risk.

## Data

- Data source: The Pima Indians Diabetes Database is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database]
- Description: The dataset contains 768 instances with the following features:
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration.
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function assessing genetic predisposition to diabetes).
- Age: Age (years).
- Outcome: Class variable (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic).

## Analysis

- Tools and libraries: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, plotly.
- File structure:
  - data: Contains the raw dataset.
  - scripts: Houses Python scripts for data cleaning, exploratory analysis and statistical analysis
- figures: Stores visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Running the analysis

- Prerequisites: Python 3.x with pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries installed.
- Instructions:
    - Clone this repository.
    - Download the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and place it in the data folder.
    - Install dependencies: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    - Run the main analysis script: python main.py (Replace "main.py" with the script name).
